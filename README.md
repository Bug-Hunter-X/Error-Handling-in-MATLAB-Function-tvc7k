This repository contains a MATLAB function that demonstrates a common error handling issue in MATLAB.  The function `myFunction` checks for negative inputs and throws an error if a negative value is encountered.  The solution demonstrates proper error handling using `try-catch` blocks.  This allows the program to gracefully handle the error and continue execution without crashing.
